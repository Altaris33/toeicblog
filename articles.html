                        Today I would like to discuss about an interesting, even fascinating subject.
                        This blog aims to talk to you every week about our discoveries combining scientific, technological and medical advances.
                        So we have to ask ourselves why medicine and new technologies have been such a good combination in recent years. The quest for youth, the end of disease is a frantic race to push back our own limits, those of the human body.
                        <br>
                        The real purpose behind all this is trans-humanism. This movement of thought, a continuity of humanism, which aims to bring humanity to a level 2.0, superhuman or post-human.
                        So that's already the case, just take a look at everything we modify, repair to be better: surgery for vision, surgery such as the fitting of prostheses. In short, we are already in this movement but here we are talking about overcoming the very idea of death and achieving immortality by merging man and computer.
                        In its modern form, this trend has existed since the 1960s in California, but the boom is now considerable thanks to artificial intelligence and large companies like Google are not fooled and clearly state their objectives in this area/in this way.
                        It is so exciting that one article is not enough to deal with the subject and all its facets, but I hope it arouses your curiosity and launches you into your own research.

                        Okay, that sounds unbelievable, but let me tell you more.
                        Like many of you I'm sure, I'm a tedtalk fan. Discovery and sharing on so many subjects, an inexhaustible concept of experiences.
                        This time, I came across a video featuring Mary Lou Jepsen, an inventor in the field of imaging and computer equipment but not only.
                        The idea is that light can be used to observe the depths of the body and brain.
                        Okay, it's easy, it's the title!
                        We've all done this before, sticking our flashlight in our hands to see the inside of the hand.
                        This is one of the first points she gives, the dispersion of light. Another important point, the de-dispersion: Yes, you have to know how to concentrate it into a kind of laser light to reach a very precise focal point.
                        In short, thanks to light, the idea is to be able to treat thousands of people quickly, accurately and at a lower cost. The comparison is made with MRIs, an incredibly expensive, imposing machine....
                        For all those who are curious and want to go further, watch the video, it's very interesting.

                        You remember the article on light to detect tumours. If you haven't read it, check out the video that matches!
                        After we detect the cancer, we'll see how to treat it.
                        Even if cancer is no longer a fatality, one in two cancers is cured, it stills the leading cause of death in France.
                        The so-called inoperable metastasis tumours could find their solutions in targeted physical approaches: nanoparticles.
                        They can detect the tumour and accumulate there, deliver a drug with active ingredients, vibrate them to activate the mechanisms of cell death or increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy by absorbing X-rays and diffusing them locally.
                        These nanoparticles really have everything they need to succeed, what do you think?
