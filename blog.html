                <p>
                    I remembered that day when my grandma had just kicked the bucket, because of 
                    the final effects of the infamous Alzheimer Disease (AD). 
                    Before that, I hadn't really given it much thought and was quite ignorant about the 
                    matter. Then, it happened, and my life go a lot different since then.
                    AD piqued my interest and I started to study it to get a deeper understanding of what it meant
                    to have this kind of disease.

                       What was the first time I freaked out when going to the dentist?
                       Well, I was something like 11 I guess, and I got totally worked up when
                       I saw the pointy object the dentist was about to use on me.
